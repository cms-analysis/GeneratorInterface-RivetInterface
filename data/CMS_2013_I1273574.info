Description: 
  Measurements are presented of exclusive 4-jet production cross 
  sections as a function of the transverse momentum $p_T$, 
  pseudorapidity $\eta$, as well as of correlations in azimuthal 
  angle and $p_T$ balance among the jets. The data sample was 
  collected at a centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV with the CMS 
  detector at the LHC, corresponding to an integrated luminosity 
  of 36 pb$^{-1}$. The jets are reconstructed with the 
  anti-$k_T$ jet algorithm in a range of $|\eta|<4.7$.
