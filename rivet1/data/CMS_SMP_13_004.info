Description:
  'The production of a Z boson, decaying into two leptons, and produced in association
with one or more b jets, is studied using proton-proton collisions delivered by
the LHC at a centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV and recorded by the CMS detector, with
a data sample collected in 2011 corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 5 fb-1.
Cross sections of the Z(ll)+b-jet(s) processes (where ll = ee or mm) are measured for
Z bosons produced in association with exactly one or at least two b jets, as well as
the cross section ratio of a Z boson produced in association with any number of b jets
relative to those containing any number of jets. The cross sections are estimated at the
particle level for events containing leptons with pT > 20 GeV and eta < 2.4, a dilepton
invariant mass 76 < Mll < 106 GeV, jets with pjT > 25 GeV and eta < 2.1, and
a separation between the leptons and the jets of DR(l, j) > 0.5. The estimated cross
sections are then compared with different theoretical predictions. Also, kinematic
properties are compared with the predictions from the MadGraph event generator,
interfaced with Pythia for the parton shower.'
